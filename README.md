Step 1: Filter out all companies with sales less than Rs 250 cr. 
Companies with sales lower than this are very small companies and might not have the business stability 
and access to finance that is required for a safe investment. This eliminates the basic business risk.

Step 5: Filter out all companies with PE ratio greater than 25 
since they are too expensive even for a high-quality company. This enables us to pick companies which are

reduce and even eliminate a lot of fundamental risks while ensuring a robust business model, strong 
earning potential and a good buying price.
